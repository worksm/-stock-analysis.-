# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project
Provide the client with more dynamic code, ensuring scalability with any additional stocks added to the dataset. These changes will ensure an accurate and timely executable no matter the size of the dataset.  

## Results: 
When comparing the stock analysis the refactored code allows the executable to run more efficiently. By creating 3 arrays,

 and adding a for loop to the output results code,

we are able to provide more sophisticated code, resulting in long-term Macros use for the client. These changes resulted in quicker execution of the program when compared to the original code source.

## Summary: 
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? 
While refactoring code can be advantageous from an efficiency and scalability standpoint, refactoring code can be time consuming and allows for increased defects and bugs in the code, which may result increased time by programmers. 
### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The pros of refactoring the VBA script were increased efficiency, resulting in more dynamic code. The refactored code benefits the end user long term.  The cons to refactoring VBA would be the strict formatting rules within VBA.
